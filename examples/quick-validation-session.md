# Quick Validation Session: Testing a New Onboarding Flow

*Generated by the IDEO Design Method Cards skill*

## Session Metadata

- **Goal**: Validate whether a redesigned onboarding flow reduces drop-off at the "connect bank account" step
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Team Size**: 2 (1 facilitator, 1 note-taker)
- **Format**: Remote (video calls)
- **Budget**: Low (no participant incentives beyond a thank-you email)

## Method Recommendation

Based on the goal (validate a specific design change), short time window, small team, and remote format, here are the recommended methods:

| # | Method | Category | Time | Why |
|---|--------|----------|------|-----|
| 1 | **Scenario Testing** | TRY | 60 min | Directly tests whether the new flow works by having real users attempt it |
| 2 | **Five Whys** | ASK | 20 min | Uncovers root causes when users hesitate or fail at specific steps |
| 3 | **Narration** | ASK | (during testing) | Users thinking aloud reveals mental models you can't observe otherwise |

These methods span 2 categories (TRY + ASK), combining hands-on testing with structured questioning.

## Session Agenda

### Pre-Session Prep (30 min before)

- [ ] Prototype loaded and tested on facilitator's machine
- [ ] Screen sharing and recording set up
- [ ] Discussion guide printed / on second screen
- [ ] Note-taking template open (see below)
- [ ] 3 participants confirmed (recruited from recent sign-ups who haven't connected a bank account yet)

### Participant 1 (0:00 - 0:35)

| Time | Activity | Method | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| 0:00 - 0:05 | Welcome, explain the session, get verbal consent to record | — | "We're testing the design, not you" |
| 0:05 - 0:20 | Walk through the onboarding prototype; ask them to narrate their thoughts | **Scenario Testing** + **Narration** | Note where they pause, what they say, facial expressions |
| 0:20 - 0:30 | Probe on any friction points: "You paused at X — can you tell me why?" | **Five Whys** | Go at least 3 levels deep on each friction point |
| 0:30 - 0:35 | Thank participant, ask for one word to describe the experience | — | Captures emotional summary |

### Participant 2 (0:35 - 1:10)

*Same structure as Participant 1*

### Participant 3 (1:10 - 1:45)

*Same structure as Participant 1*

### Debrief (1:45 - 2:00)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 1:45 - 1:50 | Each team member shares their top 3 observations |
| 1:50 - 1:55 | Identify patterns: what worked, what didn't, what surprised us |
| 1:55 - 2:00 | Decision: ship as-is, iterate on specific steps, or rethink the approach |

## Note-Taking Template

For each participant, capture:

```
Participant: [name/ID]
Date: [date]

Task Completion: [ ] Completed without help  [ ] Completed with hints  [ ] Did not complete

Step-by-Step Observations:
1. Landing page → [observation]
2. Account creation → [observation]
3. Connect bank account prompt → [observation]
4. Bank selection → [observation]
5. Authentication flow → [observation]
6. Confirmation → [observation]

Friction Points:
- Point: [where]
  Five Whys:
  1. Why? →
  2. Why? →
  3. Why? →

Quotes:
- "[exact quote]" — at [which step]

One-Word Summary: [word]
```

## Expected Outputs

- 3 completed note-taking sheets with step-by-step observations
- List of friction points with root causes (from Five Whys)
- Go/no-go decision on shipping the redesign
- If iterating: specific steps to redesign with user quotes as evidence

## Adaptation Notes

- **If fully solo**: Skip the note-taker role, record the sessions, and review recordings after. Budget an extra 30 min for self-debrief.
- **If in-person**: Have the participant use a device while you observe over their shoulder. Less screen-sharing friction, more natural body language signals.
- **If no participants available**: Run as a **Be Your Customer** session — have a teammate who hasn't seen the design attempt the flow cold. Less valid than real users but still catches major issues.
