## Expected Outputs

- 3 validated problem statements with supporting evidence
- User journey map with pain points annotated
- Affinity diagram with 8-12 insight clusters
- 1 paper prototype tested with 3 people
- Prioritized next-steps document with owners and deadlines

## Materials Needed

- Miro or FigJam board (for remote days)
- Video call tool with recording (Zoom, Google Meet)
- Physical sticky notes, markers, paper (for Day 3)
- Session recording tool (FullStory, Hotjar, or similar)
- 3-5 recruited participants (mix of churned and retained users)

## Tips

- Record all interviews (with consent) so the team can rewatch key moments
- Assign a dedicated note-taker for each interview — the interviewer should focus on the conversation
- Don't skip the homework between days — individual reflection produces better synthesis
- Day 3 works best in-person for Bodystorming, but can be adapted to remote with breakout rooms and shared whiteboarding
- Schedule participant recruitment at least 1 week before the sprint
