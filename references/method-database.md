- **Best For**: Surfacing emotions and perceptions that participants struggle to verbalize, engaging visual thinkers, making abstract experiences concrete.
- **Not For**: Gathering precise factual data; participants deeply uncomfortable with drawing (reassure them skill does not matter).
- **Pairs Well With**: Collage, Cognitive Maps, Camera Journal
- **How-To**: Give participants paper and markers and ask them to draw a specific experience (e.g., "Draw what it feels like to wait in our lobby" or "Draw your morning commute").

- **Best For**: Discovering latent needs, finding innovation opportunities, understanding the full spectrum of use from expert to beginner.
- **Not For**: Validating solutions for the mainstream; statistical representativeness; late-stage usability testing.
- **Pairs Well With**: Character Profiles, Five Whys, Scenarios, Surveys & Questionnaires
- **How-To**: Identify users at the extremes of relevant dimensions: the most and least experienced, heaviest and lightest users, youngest and oldest, most and least tech-savvy.

- **Not For**: Broad exploration; situations where the participant feels interrogated; topics requiring contextual observation.
- **Pairs Well With**: Error Analysis, Cognitive Task Analysis, Affinity Diagrams, Extreme User Interviews
- **How-To**: Start with a specific observation or statement (e.g., "Users abandon the checkout flow"). Ask "Why?" and record the answer. Ask "Why?" about that answer. Continue for approximately five iterations until you reach a fundamental cause or insight. The technique works because surface explanations are rarely the true cause; each "why" peels back a layer of assumption.
