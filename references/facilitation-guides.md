## LEARN Methods

Methods for analyzing existing knowledge, data, and context to build foundational understanding.

---

### Activity Analysis

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Collect task/workflow descriptions from stakeholders or prior observations
- Prepare a large whiteboard or wall space with sticky notes and markers
- Print out any existing process documentation or task lists
- Create a blank activity matrix template (rows = steps, columns = actors/tools/context)
- Works with 1-3 researchers. Invite additional stakeholders to join the synthesis phase for richer interpretation.

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Frame the activity scope -- define what activity or workflow you are decomposing (10 min)
2. List every discrete step, action, or sub-task participants can identify on individual sticky notes (15 min)
3. Sequence the steps on the wall in rough chronological order (10 min)
4. Identify actors, tools, environments, and decision points for each step (15 min)
5. Mark pain points, bottlenecks, and workarounds with colored dots (10 min)
6. Cluster related steps into phases and label them (10 min)
7. Discuss patterns -- where do breakdowns occur? What steps are redundant? (15 min)
8. Photograph and document the final activity map (5 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Staying too high-level: push participants to break activities into atomic steps, not broad phases
- Ignoring informal workarounds: explicitly ask "what do people actually do vs. what they are supposed to do?"
- Letting one person dominate: have everyone write steps individually before group discussion

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use Miro, FigJam, or MURAL with a pre-built template of columns and swim lanes
- Have participants silently add sticky notes for 5 minutes before discussing (async-first)
- Use breakout rooms for small-group step identification, then reconvene to merge

**Output**: Activity decomposition map showing sequenced steps, actors, tools, decision points, and annotated pain points

---

### Affinity Diagrams

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Gather all raw data: interview quotes, observation notes, survey responses, etc.
- Write each data point on an individual sticky note (or prepare them digitally)
- Secure a large blank wall or table surface (minimum 6 x 4 feet)
- Provide markers, sticky notes in multiple colors, and tape
- Limit the group to 3-8 people for effective clustering

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Briefly review the data sources and project goals so everyone shares context (5 min)
2. Spread all sticky notes randomly on the wall -- no pre-sorting (5 min)
3. Silent clustering: participants move notes into groups that feel related -- no talking allowed (15-20 min)
4. If someone moves a note back, duplicate it so it appears in both clusters (ongoing)
5. Once movement slows, review each cluster and draft a theme header for it (15 min)
6. Look for super-clusters (themes of themes) and outliers that do not fit anywhere (10 min)
7. Discuss the meaning of each cluster: what does this tell us? (15 min)
8. Prioritize clusters by marking which ones are most surprising or actionable (10 min)
9. Photograph the wall and transcribe themes and supporting data points (5 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Naming clusters before grouping: let patterns emerge bottom-up, not top-down
- Having too few data points: aim for 50-200 individual notes for meaningful patterns
- Rushing the silent phase: the magic is in the wordless negotiation -- do not cut it short
- Creating a "miscellaneous" pile: every outlier is a potential insight -- examine them carefully

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use Miro or FigJam with all notes pre-loaded as digital stickies
- Enable silent clustering by muting all participants and using a timer
- Color-code notes by data source so origin is visible during clustering

**Output**: Themed clusters of qualitative data with labeled headers, revealing patterns and key insight areas

---

### Anthropometric Analysis

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Identify the physical context: what product, space, or tool is being designed
- Gather anthropometric data tables (e.g., ANSUR, Dreyfuss, Tilley's "The Measure of Man and Woman")
- Determine the target user population and relevant percentile ranges (typically 5th to 95th)
- Prepare measurement tools if doing original data collection (tape measures, calipers, camera)
- Print or display relevant body dimension charts and ergonomic guidelines

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Define the design problem and which body dimensions are relevant (10 min)
2. Review published anthropometric data for the target population -- note age, gender, ethnicity variables (15 min)
3. If needed, take measurements of representative users in context (30-60 min)
4. Map critical dimensions to the design: reach envelopes, clearances, sight lines, grip sizes (20 min)
5. Create a summary table of min/max/mean dimensions that constrain the design (15 min)
6. Identify design implications: what must adjust, what can be fixed, what needs multiple sizes (15 min)
7. Sketch design boundaries overlaid with human dimension ranges (15 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Designing for the average: the "average" person does not exist -- design for the range or make it adjustable
- Ignoring seated vs. standing differences: always specify the posture context
- Forgetting clothing and equipment: real users wear shoes, gloves, coats, carry bags

**Remote Adaptation**
- Share anthropometric reference tables via screen share
- Have participants self-measure and submit dimensions via a shared spreadsheet
- Use 3D modeling tools (Fusion 360 human models) to demonstrate dimensional constraints

**Output**: Dimensional constraints document mapping critical body measurements to specific design parameters

---

### Character Profiles

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Compile existing user research data (interviews, surveys, observations)
- Prepare a character profile template with sections: demographics, goals, frustrations, behaviors, quotes, context
- Print example profiles from past projects for reference
- Gather images or illustrations to represent different user archetypes
- Book a room with a projector or large display for collaborative work

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Review the research data together and identify distinct user segments (15 min)
2. For each segment, brainstorm the defining characteristics -- what makes this user type unique (10 min per segment)
3. Give each character a name and a one-sentence description (5 min)
4. Fill in the profile template: goals, behaviors, pain points, context of use (15 min per profile)
5. Add a representative quote pulled directly from research data (5 min per profile)
6. Select or create a representative image for each character (5 min per profile)
7. Review all profiles together -- are there gaps? Overlaps? Missing extremes? (10 min)
8. Validate profiles against the original data to ensure they are grounded, not fictional (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Making profiles too demographic-focused: prioritize behaviors, goals, and motivations over age/gender
- Creating aspirational users instead of real ones: ground every attribute in actual research data
- Creating too many profiles: 3-5 is the sweet spot for most projects
- Treating profiles as fixed personas: update them as you learn more

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use a shared document template (Google Docs/Notion) with one section per character
- Assign pairs to draft one profile each in breakout rooms, then reconvene to review
- Use stock photo sites collaboratively to select representative images

**Output**: 3-5 rich character profiles grounded in research, each with goals, behaviors, frustrations, and a representative quote

---

### Cognitive Task Analysis

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Identify 2-4 domain experts who perform the target task regularly
- Prepare a semi-structured interview guide focused on decision-making and mental models
- Record prior task descriptions or standard operating procedures for reference
- Set up audio/video recording equipment (with consent)
- Create a blank decision tree or flow template to fill during the session

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Explain the goal: to understand the knowledge, decisions, and strategies experts use (5 min)
2. Ask the expert to walk through a recent instance of the task step by step (15-20 min)
3. At each decision point, probe: "What cues did you notice? What were you considering? What could go wrong?" (20-30 min)
4. Ask about exceptions: "When does this NOT work? What makes a case hard?" (10 min)
5. Present scenarios with variations and ask how their approach would change (15 min)
6. Map the decisions, cues, and strategies onto a visual decision flow (15 min)
7. Validate the map with the expert -- "Does this capture how you think about it?" (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Accepting surface-level answers: experts often automate their thinking -- keep probing with "how do you know that?"
- Confusing procedure with cognition: you want the mental model, not just the steps
- Interviewing only one expert: compare multiple experts to find shared vs. idiosyncratic strategies

**Remote Adaptation**
- Conduct interviews via video call with screen sharing for tasks done on computers
- Use a shared whiteboard (Miro) to build the decision map in real time
- Record sessions for later analysis since remote interviews miss some nonverbal cues

**Output**: Cognitive task map showing expert decision points, cues, strategies, and common failure modes

---

### Competitive Product Survey

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define the competitive landscape: direct competitors, indirect alternatives, aspirational benchmarks
- Acquire or gain access to 5-15 competing products or services
- Create a comparison matrix template with evaluation criteria relevant to your project
- Assign team members to review 2-3 products each in advance
- Gather materials: products themselves, screenshots, marketing materials, user reviews

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Align on evaluation criteria as a team -- what dimensions matter most? (10 min)
2. Each team member presents their assigned products with live demos when possible (5 min each, 30-45 min total)
3. Fill in the comparison matrix collaboratively on a whiteboard or shared sheet (15 min)
4. Identify best-in-class features across the landscape (10 min)
5. Identify common weaknesses and unmet needs across competitors (10 min)
6. Map the competitive landscape on a 2x2 matrix using the two most important dimensions (10 min)
7. Discuss opportunity spaces: where is no one doing well? Where is the bar already high? (15 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Only looking at direct competitors: indirect alternatives and adjacent industries reveal innovation opportunities
- Evaluating only features: also assess experience quality, pricing models, ecosystem, and support
- Being swayed by marketing: test the actual product, read real user reviews, look at churn data

**Remote Adaptation**
- Create a shared spreadsheet with product links, screenshots, and review summaries
- Use screen sharing for live product walkthroughs
- Have team members record short Loom videos of their product reviews before the session

**Output**: Competitive comparison matrix with landscape map showing opportunity spaces and best-in-class benchmarks

---

### Cross-Cultural Comparisons

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Identify 2-4 cultural contexts relevant to the design challenge
- Research basic cultural dimensions (Hofstede, Trompenaars, or Erin Meyer's culture map) for each context
- Gather examples of how the target activity or product is used in each culture
- If possible, recruit cultural informants or team members from those contexts
- Prepare a comparison template with rows for the activity and columns for each culture

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Frame the comparison: what specific behavior or need are we examining across cultures? (5 min)
2. Present research on each cultural context -- avoid stereotypes, focus on observed patterns (10 min per culture)
3. For each culture, map how the target activity is performed, valued, and contextualized (15 min per culture)
4. Identify similarities across cultures -- these may represent universal human needs (10 min)
5. Identify differences -- these reveal cultural assumptions embedded in current designs (10 min)
6. Discuss design implications: what must adapt per culture? What can be universal? (15 min)
7. Generate design principles that respect cultural variation (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Treating cultures as monolithic: there is always variation within any culture
- Confusing correlation with causation: a cultural difference does not explain why something works differently
- Privileging your own culture as "normal": frame all cultures as equally valid alternatives

**Remote Adaptation**
- Invite cultural informants to join video calls from their local context
- Share photo essays or video clips showing the activity in different cultural settings
- Use a collaborative board to collect observations asynchronously across time zones

**Output**: Cross-cultural comparison document highlighting universal needs, cultural-specific patterns, and design principles for cultural sensitivity

---

### Error Analysis

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Collect error reports, bug logs, customer complaints, support tickets, or incident records
- Categorize errors by type, frequency, and severity before the session
- Prepare a Pareto chart or frequency analysis of the most common errors
- Invite team members familiar with the system, product, or process being analyzed
- Create a root-cause analysis template (fishbone diagram or 5 Whys worksheet)

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Present the error data overview: what types of errors, how often, how severe (10 min)
2. Select the top 3-5 errors for deep analysis based on frequency and impact (5 min)
3. For each error, reconstruct the sequence of events that led to it (10 min per error)
4. Apply root cause analysis: ask "why" repeatedly until you reach systemic causes (10 min per error)
5. Classify root causes: is it a design issue, training issue, system issue, or environmental issue? (10 min)
6. Brainstorm interventions for each root cause category (15 min)
7. Prioritize interventions by effort vs. impact (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Blaming the user: errors almost always point to design failures, not user failures
- Stopping at symptoms: "user clicked the wrong button" is a symptom -- why was the wrong button clickable?
- Ignoring near-misses: errors that almost happened reveal the same systemic weaknesses

**Remote Adaptation**
- Share error data via a pre-read document sent 24 hours before the session
- Use a shared Miro board with pre-built fishbone diagram templates
- Use polling to prioritize which errors to analyze deeply

**Output**: Root cause analysis document with prioritized error categories, systemic causes, and ranked intervention recommendations

---

### Flow Analysis

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Identify the flow to analyze: information flow, material flow, user flow, or process flow
- Gather existing flow documentation, system diagrams, or process maps
- Prepare observation data showing how things actually move through the system
- Create a blank flow diagram template on a whiteboard or digital tool
- Invite people who work at different stages of the flow

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Define the flow boundaries: where does it start and end? What moves through it? (5 min)
2. Map the current-state flow with participants, capturing every step and handoff (20 min)
3. Annotate each step with: time duration, responsible party, tools used, failure modes (15 min)
4. Identify bottlenecks where flow slows down or stops (10 min)
5. Identify leaks where things fall out of the flow or get lost (10 min)
6. Identify loops where things cycle back unnecessarily (10 min)
7. Compare the actual flow to the intended flow -- where do they diverge? (10 min)
8. Sketch an ideal future-state flow that addresses the identified issues (15 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Mapping the official process instead of the actual process: observe and ask, do not just read documentation
- Ignoring the human experience of the flow: how does it feel to be at each stage?
- Making the diagram too complex: focus on the primary path first, then add branches

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use Lucidchart, Miro, or draw.io for collaborative flow diagramming
- Walk through the flow via screen share with someone who performs it daily
- Record screen captures of digital flows for asynchronous annotation

**Output**: Current-state and future-state flow diagrams with annotated bottlenecks, leaks, and improvement opportunities

---

### Historical Analysis

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Research the history of the product category, technology, or behavior being designed for
- Create a timeline template spanning relevant decades or eras
- Gather historical artifacts: old product photos, ads, patents, news articles
- Identify 3-5 pivotal moments or inflection points in the history
- Prepare questions about what drove change at each inflection point

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Present the historical timeline with key milestones and context (15 min)
2. Examine each major shift: what technology, social change, or event drove it? (15 min)
3. Identify patterns: are there recurring cycles, pendulum swings, or steady trends? (10 min)
4. Map failed innovations and dead ends -- why did they fail? (10 min)
5. Project current trends forward: if the pattern continues, what comes next? (10 min)
6. Identify historical analogies to the current design challenge (10 min)
7. Extract design principles from historical lessons (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Survivor bias: studying only successful products misses lessons from failures
- Assuming linear progress: history often moves in cycles or makes lateral shifts
- Ignoring social and economic context: technology does not evolve in isolation

**Remote Adaptation**
- Create a digital timeline in Miro or Google Slides with embedded images and links
- Share a pre-read packet of historical materials 48 hours before the session
- Use breakout rooms for small groups to analyze different eras, then reconvene

**Output**: Historical timeline with trend analysis, pattern identification, and forward-looking design implications

---

### Long-Range Forecasts

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Gather trend reports from relevant industries (Gartner, McKinsey, IFTF, etc.)
- Identify key drivers of change: technology, demographics, regulation, culture, economics
- Prepare a futures framework (e.g., STEEP analysis, three horizons, scenario matrix)
- Invite diverse perspectives: technologists, social scientists, business strategists, end users
- Define the time horizon: 5, 10, or 20+ years out

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Align on the forecasting question: what aspect of the future are we exploring? (5 min)
2. Present key trend data and drivers of change (15 min)
3. Identify certainties (things very likely to happen) vs. uncertainties (things that could go either way) (15 min)
4. Select the two most impactful uncertainties as axes for a scenario matrix (10 min)
5. Develop 4 distinct future scenarios, one per quadrant -- give each a memorable name (20 min)
6. For each scenario, describe: what daily life looks like, what products/services exist, what is valued (15 min)
7. Identify design strategies that work across multiple scenarios (robust strategies) (15 min)
8. Identify early signals that would indicate which scenario is emerging (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Forecasting a single future: always develop multiple scenarios to avoid false certainty
- Ignoring undesirable scenarios: dystopian futures are still plausible and must be designed for
- Making scenarios too similar: push for genuine diversity in the scenarios

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use a shared Miro board with a pre-built 2x2 scenario matrix template
- Assign each scenario to a breakout group to flesh out in detail
- Use async pre-work to gather trend data and initial predictions before the live session

**Output**: Scenario set (typically 4) with narrative descriptions, implications for design, and early warning signals

---

### Secondary Research

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define research questions and knowledge gaps that need filling
- Identify relevant databases and sources: academic (Google Scholar, JSTOR), industry (Statista, IBISWorld), government (Census, BLS), news
- Create a research brief template: question, source, key findings, implications
- Assign research domains to team members based on expertise
- Set a time box for the research phase (typically 2-5 days)

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Align on research questions and prioritize them by importance to the project (15 min)
2. Assign questions to researchers, 2-3 questions each (5 min)
3. Individual research phase: each person investigates their assigned questions (2-5 days async)
4. Compile findings in a shared document using the research brief template (async)
5. Conduct a synthesis session: each person presents key findings (5 min each, 30-45 min total)
6. Discuss conflicts between sources and assess reliability (10 min)
7. Identify remaining gaps and decide if primary research is needed to fill them (10 min)
8. Summarize actionable insights and add to the project knowledge base (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Relying on a single source: triangulate findings across multiple sources
- Confusing correlation with causation in statistical data
- Getting lost in research without a clear stopping point: time-box aggressively
- Only reading abstracts: key nuances are often in the methodology and limitations sections

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use a shared Notion database or Google Sheet to track research sources and findings
- Conduct the synthesis session via video call with screen sharing
- Use Zotero or Mendeley for collaborative reference management

**Output**: Research synthesis document with sourced findings mapped to project questions, confidence levels, and identified knowledge gaps

### A Day in the Life

**Preparation** (before the session)
- **Recruitment**: Recruit through your customer database or user community. Offer clear value exchange for their extended time commitment.
- **Ethics**: Extended observation requires strong trust. Be transparent about what you'll document. Give participants review rights over any notes or photos before they're shared.
- Recruit 1-3 participants willing to be observed throughout a full day (or significant portion)
- Obtain informed consent covering observation, photography, and data use
- Prepare an observation guide with key moments to watch for (morning routine, commute, work, meals, etc.)
- Pack observation kit: notebook, camera, voice recorder, snacks, comfortable shoes
- Brief the team on observation etiquette: be unobtrusive, do not judge, ask permission before recording

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Meet the participant at the start of their day and explain the process (10 min)
2. Shadow them through their routine, observing and noting everything without interrupting (ongoing, 4-8 hours)
3. Take photographs of environments, tools, artifacts, and spatial arrangements (ongoing)
4. Note emotional moments: frustration, joy, boredom, confusion -- these reveal unmet needs (ongoing)
5. During natural breaks, ask brief clarifying questions: "What were you thinking just then?" (5 min each)
6. At the end, conduct a short debrief interview: "What was typical today? What was unusual?" (15 min)
7. Write up detailed field notes within 24 hours while memory is fresh (60-90 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Changing the participant's behavior by being too visible or interactive: fade into the background
- Only noting functional activities: emotional and social dimensions are equally important
- Scheduling on an atypical day: confirm that the observation day represents normal routine
- Not debriefing soon enough: field notes decay rapidly if not written up promptly

**Remote Adaptation**
- Ask participants to self-document with a camera journal (photos + voice memos throughout the day)
- Use video calls at 3-4 key moments during the day for real-time observation
- Provide a structured diary template for the participant to fill in between check-ins

**Output**: Detailed day-in-the-life narrative with photographs, annotated timeline, emotional journey, and key observations

---

### Behavioral Archaeology

**Preparation** (before the session)
- **Ethics**: Obtain permission before examining personal spaces or belongings. Respect boundaries — if something feels too private, it probably is.
- Identify the space or environment to study (home, office, public space, vehicle, etc.)
- Obtain access permission and schedule observation when the space is unoccupied
- Prepare a documentation kit: camera, measuring tape, notebook, evidence bags or labels
- Create an observation checklist: wear patterns, arrangement of objects, modifications, traces of use
- Plan to photograph the space systematically before touching or moving anything

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Enter the space and photograph it thoroughly from multiple angles before disturbing anything (15 min)
2. Catalog visible artifacts: what objects are present, where are they positioned, what condition are they in? (20 min)
3. Look for wear patterns: scratched surfaces, worn buttons, faded labels, dirty areas (15 min)
4. Note spatial relationships: what is kept close together? What is hidden? What is displayed prominently? (15 min)
5. Identify modifications and workarounds: tape, shims, labels, re-purposed objects (15 min)
6. Look for evidence of abandoned behaviors: unused equipment, outdated materials (10 min)
7. Photograph all notable findings with context shots and close-ups (ongoing)
8. Compile findings into an "archaeological report" with photos and interpretations (30-60 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Projecting your own interpretations: note what you see first, then separately note what you think it means
- Missing the "dog that did not bark": what is absent can be as revealing as what is present
- Only looking at surfaces: check drawers, closets, and hidden areas -- people hide telling objects

**Remote Adaptation**
- Ask participants to give a video tour of their space, narrating what they see
- Send a photo assignment: "photograph your workspace from 4 angles" and "photograph 3 objects you use every day"
- Use Google Street View for public space analysis when physical access is not possible

**Output**: Behavioral archaeology report with annotated photographs documenting wear patterns, spatial arrangements, modifications, and inferred behaviors

---

### Behavioral Mapping

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Obtain or create a floor plan or map of the space to be observed
- Define the behaviors to track (movement paths, stationary activities, interactions, etc.)
- Determine observation periods (time of day, duration, frequency)
- Prepare multiple copies of the map for each observation session
- Recruit 2-3 observers if the space is large -- assign zones
- Establish a coding system: colors or symbols for different behavior types

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Brief observers on the coding system and behavior categories (10 min)
2. Position observers where they can see their assigned zones without obstructing activity (5 min)
3. Observe and record: mark movement paths, stopping points, and activities on the map at timed intervals (30-60 min per session)
4. Repeat observations at different times of day and days of the week (multiple sessions)
5. Overlay all observation maps to see aggregate patterns (15 min)
6. Identify hot spots (high activity), dead zones (no activity), and desire paths (unofficial routes) (15 min)
7. Correlate patterns with environmental features: furniture, signage, lighting, noise (10 min)
8. Generate design recommendations based on observed vs. intended use of the space (15 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Observing at only one time: behavior patterns shift throughout the day -- sample multiple times
- Recording too many behaviors at once: focus on 3-4 key behaviors per session
- Ignoring the influence of your presence: position yourself to minimize the observer effect

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use security camera footage or time-lapse recordings (with privacy consent)
- For digital spaces, use analytics heatmaps (Hotjar, FullStory) as behavioral maps
- Create digital overlay maps using Google Slides or Figma layers

**Output**: Composite behavioral map showing movement patterns, activity hot spots, dead zones, and spatial use analysis

---

### Fly on the Wall

**Preparation** (before the session)
- **Ethics**: Get permission from space owners before observing. In public spaces, be aware of local recording laws. Never observe in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy.
- Identify the setting and activity to observe (store, office, public space, event, etc.)
- Obtain any needed permissions for the observation location
- Prepare an observation kit: notebook, pen, camera (discreet), timer
- Define focus areas: what behaviors, interactions, or moments to watch for
- Plan your position: where can you observe without being noticed or influencing behavior?

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Arrive early and settle into an unobtrusive observation position (5 min)
2. Spend the first 10 minutes just absorbing the scene without writing -- get a feel for the rhythm (10 min)
3. Begin systematic observation: note behaviors, interactions, sequences, and environmental factors (30-60 min)
4. Record everything without filtering: timestamps, quotes (if overheard), body language, spatial behavior
5. Pay special attention to: moments of confusion, delight, frustration, or improvisation (ongoing)
6. Note environmental factors: noise, lighting, crowding, temperature -- how do they affect behavior? (ongoing)
7. Take discreet photographs to supplement notes (ongoing)
8. Write up observation notes within a few hours, distinguishing observation from interpretation (30-60 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Filtering observations in real time: write down everything, even things that seem unimportant
- Blending observation with interpretation: use two columns -- "I saw" and "I think it means"
- Staying too short: meaningful patterns emerge after 30+ minutes of observation
- Choosing a bad vantage point: test sight lines before the observation period begins

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use publicly available livestreams or recorded footage of relevant environments
- For digital product observation, use screen recording with user consent
- Observe public online forums, social media, or community spaces as a "fly on the wall"

**Output**: Detailed observation notes with separated observations and interpretations, annotated with timestamps and photographs

---

### Guided Tours

**Preparation** (before the session)
- **Recruitment**: Recruit from existing customers willing to show their workspace/environment. A warm introduction through account managers works best.
- Recruit 2-4 participants to give tours of their relevant space (home, workspace, neighborhood)
- Explain the concept: they are the expert guide, you are the curious visitor
- Prepare prompting questions for each area or object they show you
- Bring documentation tools: camera, voice recorder, notebook
- Schedule 45-90 minutes per tour

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Ask the participant to show you around as if you have never been there before (5 min intro)
2. Let them lead -- follow their route and priorities, do not redirect (ongoing)
3. At each stop, ask: "Tell me about this. Why is this here? How do you use it?" (2-3 min per stop)
4. Notice what they choose to show and what they skip -- both are informative (ongoing)
5. Ask about things you notice that they do not mention: "What about this?" (occasional probes)
6. Photograph key areas and objects they discuss (ongoing)
7. At the end, ask: "Is there anything you wanted to show me but did not?" (5 min)
8. Conduct a brief sit-down debrief to capture overall impressions (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Taking over the tour: let the participant set the pace and path
- Only focusing on objects: ask about routines, memories, and feelings associated with spaces
- Not asking "why": every placement, modification, and display is a decision worth understanding

**Remote Adaptation**
- Conduct virtual tours via video call with the participant walking around with their phone
- Ask participants to pre-record a video tour with narration
- Use Google Maps / Street View for neighborhood or area tours as a supplement

**Output**: Annotated tour documentation with photographs, participant narratives, and inferred priorities and values

---

### Personal Inventory

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Recruit 3-6 participants willing to share the contents of a personal space (bag, desk, wallet, fridge, etc.)
- Define which inventory context is relevant to your research question
- Prepare a documentation surface: a clean table or sheet where items can be laid out and photographed
- Bring a camera, labels or numbered cards, and an interview guide
- Ensure participants know they can exclude any item they are not comfortable sharing

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Ask the participant to empty the designated space completely onto the table (5 min)
2. Photograph the full spread before discussion (2 min)
3. Ask them to sort the items by any criteria they choose -- note what categories they create (5 min)
4. Go through each item or group: "What is this? Why do you carry/keep it? How often do you use it?" (15-20 min)
5. Ask: "Which item could you not live without? Which surprised you to find in there?" (5 min)
6. Note emotional attachments, duplicates, workarounds, and items that serve multiple purposes (ongoing)
7. Ask about missing items: "Is there something you wish you had but don't?" (5 min)
8. Photograph the sorted arrangement and specific items of interest (5 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Making judgments (even nonverbally) about items: maintain neutral curiosity throughout
- Rushing through items: seemingly mundane objects often have the most interesting stories
- Ignoring the organizational system: how someone organizes their stuff reveals mental models

**Remote Adaptation**
- Ask participants to photograph their inventory and upload to a shared folder
- Conduct the interview via video call while they show items to the camera
- Use a shared Miro board where participants place photos of their items

**Output**: Photographed inventory with item-by-item annotations, usage patterns, and identified needs and values

### Rapid Ethnography

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define the research focus: what behaviors, contexts, and questions are most important
- Recruit 3-5 participants from the target user group
- Plan a compressed fieldwork schedule (1-3 days instead of weeks)
- Prepare a field guide with observation priorities and interview questions
- Assemble a documentation kit for each researcher: camera, notebook, recorder, consent forms
- Brief the team on ethnographic principles: observe before asking, respect the context, note everything

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Begin with contextual observation: spend 30-60 minutes in the participant's environment before interacting (30-60 min)
2. Conduct an in-context interview while the participant demonstrates their activities (45-60 min)
3. Document artifacts: photograph tools, spaces, notes, workarounds they use (15 min)
4. Ask the participant to walk you through a specific task or scenario relevant to the research (20 min)
5. Probe for stories: "Tell me about the last time..." rather than hypothetical questions (10 min)
6. Between participants, do quick team debriefs to share emerging patterns (15 min per debrief)
7. After all fieldwork, conduct a team synthesis session to identify key themes (60-90 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Asking leading questions: use "tell me about..." not "do you find it frustrating when..."
- Not spending enough time observing before interviewing: observation grounds the conversation
- Treating rapid as superficial: the compression is in time, not depth -- go deep on fewer topics

**Remote Adaptation**
- Conduct video call interviews with screen sharing and self-guided environment tours
- Use diary studies (3-5 day photo/voice journals) as a complement to interviews
- Have participants record themselves performing key tasks before the interview

**Output**: Ethnographic field report with observation notes, participant profiles, key themes, and supporting photographs

---

### Shadowing

**Preparation** (before the session)
- **Recruitment**: Recruit through direct outreach to customers or partner organizations. Ensure participants are comfortable being observed for extended periods.
- **Ethics**: Get explicit informed consent. Establish clear boundaries about what activities and spaces are on/off limits. Allow participants to pause or end the session at any time.
- Recruit 1-3 participants to be shadowed during their relevant activities
- Obtain informed consent for observation and documentation
- Define the shadowing period: 2-8 hours depending on the activity cycle
- Prepare an observation guide focused on moments of decision, difficulty, and improvisation
- Pack a discreet observation kit: small notebook, phone camera, voice recorder

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Meet the participant and establish ground rules: you follow, they lead -- they should try to forget you are there (5 min)
2. Follow them through their activities, maintaining appropriate distance (2-3 feet in most settings) (ongoing)
3. Note observable behaviors, not your interpretations -- what they do, say, touch, look at (ongoing)
4. Record transitions between activities and contexts: these are often where friction occurs (ongoing)
5. Limit questions during shadowing to brief clarifications: "What just happened there?" (occasional)
6. Pay attention to micro-behaviors: hesitations, glances, repeated actions, self-corrections (ongoing)
7. Conduct a debrief interview after shadowing ends: review your notes together, ask for explanations (20-30 min)
8. Write detailed field notes within 24 hours (60-90 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Asking too many questions during shadowing: the goal is observation, not interview -- save questions for the debrief
- Following too closely or conspicuously: match their pace and stay at a natural distance
- Projecting your own experience: resist the urge to assume you know why they did something

**Remote Adaptation**
- Have the participant screen-share while performing digital tasks
- Use a "thinking aloud" protocol where they narrate their actions during a video call
- For physical tasks, have them wear a body-mounted camera or use a phone on a lanyard

**Output**: Shadowing field notes with timestamped behavioral observations, debrief insights, and identified friction points

### Social Network Mapping

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define whose social network is being mapped and for what purpose
- Prepare a large sheet of paper or digital canvas
- Create different node sizes and colors for different types of connections
- Prepare interview questions about relationships, influence, and information flow
- Gather any existing organizational charts or communication data

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Place the focal person or group at the center of the map (2 min)
2. Ask: "Who do you interact with related to [topic]?" List all connections (10 min)
3. For each connection, ask: "How often? About what? Who initiates? How important is this?" (15-20 min)
4. Map the connections using line thickness for frequency and arrows for direction (10 min)
5. Identify clusters: groups of people who interact with each other (10 min)
6. Identify bridges: people who connect otherwise separate clusters (5 min)
7. Identify gaps: who should be connected but is not? (5 min)
8. Ask about the quality of relationships: trust, conflict, dependency (10 min)
9. Discuss implications: where are bottlenecks? Who are the key influencers? (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Only mapping formal relationships: informal networks often have more influence
- Assuming symmetry: just because A talks to B does not mean B talks to A
- Ignoring weak ties: peripheral connections are often sources of new information and innovation

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use Kumu, Miro, or even Google Slides for collaborative network mapping
- Conduct interviews via video call and build the map in real time via screen share
- Use email or Slack analytics (with permission) to supplement self-reported connections

**Output**: Social network map showing connections, clusters, bridges, gaps, and key influencers relevant to the design challenge

---

### Still-Photo Survey

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define the subject of the photo survey: environments, behaviors, artifacts, signs, etc.
- Prepare a shot list or themes to guide the photography
- Ensure you have a good camera (phone cameras work) and spare batteries
- Plan the survey route or locations
- Create a photo log template: photo number, location, time, description, researcher notes

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Review the shot list and survey goals with the team (10 min)
2. Conduct the photo survey: methodically photograph the defined subjects (60-120 min)
3. Take both wide-angle context shots and close-up detail shots for each subject (ongoing)
4. Fill in the photo log as you shoot -- do not rely on memory later (ongoing)
5. After the survey, review all photos and select the most informative 20-30 images (20 min)
6. Arrange selected photos by theme or sequence on a wall or digital board (15 min)
7. As a team, annotate each photo with observations and questions (20 min)
8. Identify patterns, surprises, and design implications from the visual evidence (15 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Taking too few photos: quantity enables selection -- take 3-5x more than you think you need
- Not capturing context: every detail shot needs a corresponding wide shot showing where it is
- Not annotating promptly: a photo without notes becomes meaningless within days

**Remote Adaptation**
- Assign photo surveys to participants with a clear shot list and examples
- Use Google Photos shared albums or Dropbox for collection
- Conduct the annotation session on a Miro board with uploaded photos

**Output**: Curated and annotated photo collection organized by theme, with observations and design implications

---

### Time-Lapse Video

**Preparation** (before the session)
- **Ethics**: Get explicit consent from all people who may appear in recordings. Post visible notices in recorded areas. Define retention period and access controls for footage.
- Identify the activity or space to record and the appropriate duration (hours to days)
- Select and test recording equipment: GoPro, webcam, phone with time-lapse app, or security camera
- Determine the frame rate: 1 frame per second for fast activities, 1 frame per minute for slow changes
- Secure camera mounting: tripod, clamp, or adhesive mount for stability
- Obtain permissions and informed consent from anyone who will be recorded
- Test the full setup for at least 15 minutes before the real recording

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Install and test the camera in the chosen position -- ensure the field of view captures all relevant activity (15 min)
2. Start recording and note the exact time and any initial conditions (2 min)
3. Check the recording periodically to ensure it has not stopped or shifted (every few hours)
4. After the recording period, review the footage at various playback speeds (30-60 min)
5. Mark key moments: sudden changes, patterns, rhythms, anomalies (ongoing during review)
6. Create a highlight reel of the most informative segments (15 min)
7. Analyze patterns: what is the rhythm of activity? When are peaks and lulls? What triggers changes? (20 min)
8. Share the footage with the team and discuss observations (30 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Camera running out of battery or storage: calculate needs in advance and bring extras
- Poor lighting changes: if recording over a full day, ensure auto-exposure is enabled
- Recording too short a period: behaviors often have daily or weekly cycles -- plan accordingly

**Remote Adaptation**
- Ask participants to set up a phone time-lapse in their space with guidance
- Use screen recording time-lapse for digital workspace observation
- Cloud-connected cameras (Wyze, Nest) allow remote monitoring and review

**Output**: Time-lapse footage with annotated highlight reel showing activity patterns, rhythms, and notable behavioral moments

## ASK Methods

Methods for engaging people directly to learn about their experiences, perceptions, and ideas.

---

### Camera Journal

**Preparation** (before the session)
- **Recruitment**: Recruit participants comfortable with self-documentation. Provide clear instructions and example entries. Send reminders during the collection period.
- **Ethics**: Ensure participants understand how their photos/entries will be used and stored. Provide clear data handling and privacy commitments. Allow participants to redact entries.
- Recruit 3-8 participants willing to self-document over 3-7 days
- Provide each participant with a disposable camera or instructions for using their phone
- Create a prompt booklet with daily photography assignments (e.g., "photograph your morning routine," "photograph something that frustrates you")
- Include a simple journal template: for each photo, note what it shows and why you took it
- Schedule a follow-up interview 1-2 days after the journal period ends

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Brief participants: explain the purpose, hand out materials, walk through the prompts (15 min per person)
2. Send daily reminders with that day's prompt (via text or email) (1 min daily)
3. Be available for questions but do not over-direct -- let participants interpret prompts freely (ongoing)
4. Collect journals and photos at the end of the period
5. Review all submissions before the interview -- note surprises, patterns, and questions (30 min per participant)
6. Conduct the follow-up interview using photos as conversation anchors: "Tell me about this one" (30-45 min per participant)
7. Compile findings across all participants -- look for shared themes and unique perspectives (60 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Giving too many prompts: 1-2 per day is enough -- more creates fatigue
- Not following up with interviews: the photos are conversation starters, not data by themselves
- Assuming you understand a photo's meaning: always ask the participant to explain their intent

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use a shared Google Drive folder or dedicated Slack channel for photo submissions
- Send prompts via text message or WhatsApp at the same time each day
- Conduct follow-up interviews via video call with photos screen-shared

**Output**: Photo journal collection with participant narratives, cross-participant theme analysis, and key insights

---

### Card Sort

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Identify the items to be sorted: features, content categories, concepts, priorities, etc.
- Write each item on an individual card or sticky note (30-100 items is typical)
- Decide between open sort (participants create categories) or closed sort (you provide categories)
- Recruit 5-15 participants individually or in pairs
- Prepare a recording sheet to capture each participant's groupings and labels
- Have blank cards available for items participants want to add

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Spread all cards on a table and explain the task: "Group these in a way that makes sense to you" (5 min)
2. Let the participant sort silently first -- do not help or suggest groupings (10-15 min)
3. When they are done, ask them to name each group (5 min)
4. Ask about difficult decisions: "Which cards were hard to place? Why?" (5 min)
5. Ask about the groups: "Why did these go together? What makes this group different from that one?" (10 min)
6. If doing open sort, ask: "Could you organize these differently? What would that look like?" (5 min optional)
7. Photograph the final arrangement and record all groupings (5 min)
8. Repeat with additional participants -- aim for at least 5 for open sorts, 15 for closed sorts

**Common Mistakes**
- Influencing the sort with your reactions: maintain a neutral expression regardless of groupings
- Using jargon on cards: write in the participant's language, not your internal terminology
- Not asking about the outliers: items that do not fit anywhere often reveal the most about mental models

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use OptimalSort, UXtweak, or a Miro board with movable cards
- For unmoderated remote sorts, include clear instructions and a text field for category labels
- For moderated remote sorts, screen share and have participants direct you to move cards

**Output**: Category structure data showing how participants organize concepts, with group labels, problematic items, and patterns across participants

---

### Cognitive Maps

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define the topic or system to be mapped (a neighborhood, a product ecosystem, a process, etc.)
- Recruit 3-8 participants who experience the topic differently
- Provide large blank paper (11x17 or larger) and colored markers
- Have simple examples of cognitive maps to show (but not too directive)
- Prepare follow-up questions about the map contents

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Give participants a sheet of paper and ask: "Draw how you think about [topic] -- there is no right or wrong way" (2 min intro)
2. Let them draw without interruption -- resist the urge to clarify or redirect (10-15 min)
3. Ask them to walk you through their map: "Start anywhere and tell me about it" (10-15 min)
4. Probe specific elements: "Why is this bigger? Why are these connected? What is missing?" (10 min)
5. Ask about boundaries: "Where does [topic] end for you? What is outside the map?" (5 min)
6. Compare maps across participants: what is shared? What is unique? What is contradictory? (15 min team discussion)
7. Photograph all maps and create a composite view of shared elements (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Giving too much instruction: the value is in seeing how THEY structure the topic, not how you do
- Dismissing "bad" drawings: artistic quality is irrelevant -- focus on the structure and content
- Comparing maps judgmentally: differences between maps are insights, not errors

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use a digital whiteboard tool and give participants freeform drawing access
- Alternatively, ask participants to draw on paper, photograph it, and share via video call
- For async collection, provide a template with a blank center area and instructions

**Output**: Collection of cognitive maps with analysis of shared structures, unique perspectives, and mental model patterns

---

### Collage

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Gather a large collection of diverse images: magazine clippings, printed photos, abstract textures, symbols (200+ images per participant)
- Provide large poster boards, glue sticks, scissors, and markers
- Define the collage prompt related to your research question (e.g., "Create a collage that represents your ideal morning routine")
- Recruit 4-8 participants
- Set up a spacious work area where materials can spread out

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Explain the exercise: "Using these images, create a collage that expresses [prompt]. There is no wrong answer." (5 min)
2. Let participants browse and select images silently (10 min)
3. Give time for collage creation -- play background music to keep the mood relaxed (20-30 min)
4. When finished, have each participant present their collage to the group (3-5 min each)
5. Ask clarifying questions: "Why did you choose this image? What does this section represent?" (5 min each)
6. Invite group discussion: "What do you notice across the collages?" (10 min)
7. Photograph all collages with close-ups of key sections (5 min)
8. In the team debrief, analyze recurring images, themes, and emotional tones (15 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Providing too few images: scarcity limits expression -- more variety enables richer collages
- Interpreting images without asking: the same image means different things to different people
- Rushing the creation phase: the meditative quality of collage-making surfaces subconscious associations

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use a digital collage tool: Google Slides, Canva, or Miro with a shared image library
- Provide a curated Google Drive folder of 200+ images for participants to drag onto their canvas
- Alternatively, ask participants to collect images from the internet that respond to the prompt

**Output**: Participant collages with transcribed explanations, thematic analysis of recurring imagery, and emotional tone mapping

---

### Conceptual Landscape

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define the concept space to explore (e.g., "healthy eating" or "workplace productivity")
- Create a large canvas (physical or digital) with two labeled axes representing key dimensions
- Prepare cards or sticky notes with relevant concepts, products, or ideas to be positioned
- Recruit 4-8 participants familiar with the domain
- Have additional blank cards for concepts participants want to add

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Introduce the two axes and what they represent -- ensure everyone understands the dimensions (5 min)
2. Hand out the pre-made concept cards and blank cards (2 min)
3. One at a time, have participants place each card on the landscape and explain their reasoning (1-2 min per card, 20-30 min total)
4. Encourage debate when participants disagree on placement -- discussion reveals assumptions (ongoing)
5. After all cards are placed, look for clusters, gaps, and outliers (10 min)
6. Discuss: "Where is there a gap in this landscape? What belongs there but does not exist yet?" (10 min)
7. Try alternative axes: "What if we used different dimensions?" (10 min optional)
8. Photograph and document the final landscape with rationale for key placements (5 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Choosing dimensions that are too abstract: axes should be concrete enough for participants to use them
- Not allowing debate: disagreement about placement is where the insights live
- Ignoring the gaps: empty spaces on the landscape are opportunity areas

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use Miro or FigJam with a pre-drawn 2x2 or coordinate system
- Give participants edit access to drag and place concept cards
- Use dot voting to resolve placement disagreements

**Output**: Visual concept landscape showing how ideas relate along key dimensions, with identified gaps and opportunity spaces

---

### Cultural Probes

**Preparation** (before the session)
- **Recruitment**: Recruit curious, expressive participants through personal networks or creative communities. Screen for willingness to engage with open-ended prompts.
- **Ethics**: Handle returned materials with care — they often contain deeply personal reflections. Store securely, anonymize before sharing with wider teams.
- Design a probe kit: a collection of creative prompts mailed or delivered to participants (plan 2-3 weeks lead time)
- Kit typically includes: disposable camera with photo prompts, diary with daily questions, postcards to complete and return, maps to annotate, small creative tasks
- Package the kit attractively -- design quality signals that you value their participation
- Recruit 5-10 participants and schedule kit delivery and return
- Include clear instructions and a prepaid return envelope or digital submission method

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Deliver the probe kit with a brief introduction call or letter explaining the purpose (15 min)
2. Let participants complete the probes at their own pace over 1-2 weeks (no micromanaging)
3. Send a gentle mid-point reminder if needed (1 message)
4. Collect the completed probes
5. Spread all returned materials on a large table and review them individually (30 min per participant)
6. Look for emotional resonance, unexpected interpretations, and recurring themes (ongoing)
7. Conduct optional follow-up interviews to explore interesting probe responses (30 min per participant)
8. Compile a visual gallery of probe responses organized by theme (60 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Over-structuring the probes: leave room for personal interpretation and surprise
- Treating probes as surveys: they are meant to inspire, not to generate statistically valid data
- Not following up: probes are conversation starters -- the follow-up discussion adds crucial context

**Remote Adaptation**
- Create a digital probe kit using a mix of daily email/text prompts and online forms
- Use a dedicated Instagram account or private Slack channel for photo submissions
- Send physical kits by mail for a more tangible experience, even for remote participants

**Output**: Collection of creative probe responses with thematic analysis, highlighting participant perspectives, values, and aspirations

---

### Draw the Experience

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define the experience to be drawn (e.g., "Draw your last visit to the doctor's office")
- Provide paper and a variety of drawing tools: markers, colored pencils, crayons
- Recruit 4-8 participants who have recently had the experience
- Emphasize that drawing skill does not matter -- stick figures are welcome
- Prepare follow-up interview questions

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Give the prompt: "Draw your experience of [topic] -- include whatever comes to mind. Stick figures are great." (3 min intro)
2. Let participants draw without interruption or guidance (10-15 min)
3. Have each participant narrate their drawing to the group or to you (3-5 min each)
4. Ask about choices: "Why did you draw yourself so small here? Why is this part red? What is happening here?" (5 min each)
5. Ask about what is NOT in the drawing: "What did you leave out? Why?" (3 min each)
6. Compare drawings: what elements appear repeatedly? What is unique? (10 min group discussion)
7. Photograph all drawings with close-ups of detailed sections (5 min)
8. Analyze drawings for spatial relationships, emotional indicators, and process sequences (15 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Letting people feel embarrassed about their drawing: set the tone by showing a terrible stick figure example of your own
- Over-interpreting visual elements without asking: size, color, and position may or may not be meaningful
- Skipping the narration: the drawing without the story is only half the data

**Remote Adaptation**
- Have participants draw on paper and hold it up to the camera, or photograph and share
- Use a tablet drawing app for participants who prefer digital
- For async collection, send the prompt via email and have participants return photographed drawings

**Output**: Collection of experience drawings with narrated transcriptions, highlighting emotional moments, key actors, and process perceptions

---

### Extreme User Interviews

**Preparation** (before the session)
- **Recruitment**: Find extreme users through community forums, support tickets (power users and frustrated users), or social media groups. Screen for articulate participants.
- Define who the "extreme" users are for your context: heaviest users, non-users, workaround inventors, passionate critics, or people using the product in unexpected ways
- Recruit 3-6 extreme users from different extremes (not just power users)
- Prepare an interview guide focused on what makes their usage extreme and why
- Plan 60-90 minute sessions per participant
- Set up recording equipment (with consent)

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Begin by acknowledging their unique perspective: "We sought you out because your experience is different from most people's" (3 min)
2. Ask them to describe their relationship with the topic/product in their own words (10 min)
3. Explore the history: "How did you become a [heavy user / non-user / etc.]? What was the journey?" (10 min)
4. Deep dive into their behaviors: "Walk me through exactly how you [use / avoid / modify] it" (15 min)
5. Ask about workarounds and adaptations: "What have you created or changed to make it work for you?" (10 min)
6. Explore motivations: "What drives this level of engagement (or disengagement)?" (10 min)
7. Ask them to design their ideal solution: "If you could change anything, what would it be?" (10 min)
8. Probe for transferable insights: "What do you think most people misunderstand about [topic]?" (5 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Only interviewing power users: non-users, frustrated users, and abandoners are equally valuable extremes
- Treating extreme users as representative: they are not average -- they reveal possibilities and edges
- Not probing deeply enough: extreme users often have deeply reasoned perspectives that require patient listening

**Remote Adaptation**
- Conduct video interviews with screen sharing for digital product discussions
- Ask extreme users to pre-record a walkthrough of their setup, workflow, or usage pattern
- Use asynchronous video (Loom) for initial sharing, then follow up synchronously

**Output**: Extreme user profiles with detailed behavioral descriptions, motivations, workarounds, and design suggestions from the margins

---

### Five Whys

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Identify the problem, behavior, or observation to investigate
- Prepare a worksheet with space for 5 cascading "Why?" questions and answers
- Brief the team on the technique: keep asking "why" until you reach a root cause (typically 5 levels)
- Gather any relevant data or context about the problem
- This can be done individually, in pairs, or with a small group (2-5 people)

**Facilitation Steps**
1. State the problem or observation clearly: "The issue we are investigating is..." (3 min)
2. Ask "Why does this happen?" and record the first answer (3 min)
3. Take that answer and ask "Why?" again -- record the second-level answer (3 min)
4. Continue asking "Why?" for each answer, going deeper each time (3 min per level)
5. At each level, verify the answer with data or evidence when possible (ongoing)
6. When you reach a root cause (typically level 4-5), test it: "If we fixed this, would the original problem go away?" (5 min)
7. If there are multiple possible answers at any level, branch and follow each path (adds 10-15 min)
8. Document the full causal chain from symptom to root cause (5 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Stopping at surface causes: "the user made an error" is never a root cause -- keep asking why the error was possible
- Only following one branch: many problems have multiple contributing causes -- explore them all
- Accepting untested assumptions as answers: validate each "because" with evidence when you can

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use a shared document or Miro board with a pre-built branching template
- Conduct via video call, screen sharing the growing analysis
- Works well asynchronously: post the first Why, let team members add subsequent levels over hours

**Output**: Root cause analysis chain showing the path from observable symptom to systemic root cause, with branches for multiple causal paths

---

### Foreign Correspondents

**Preparation** (before the session)
- **Recruitment**: Identify correspondents through professional networks, cultural organizations, or local contacts in target regions.
- Identify team members or contacts currently in or recently returned from different cultural contexts, locations, or market segments
- Prepare a briefing template: what to observe, document, and report on
- Define the research question that their foreign perspective will illuminate
- Coordinate logistics: communication schedule, documentation tools, compensation
- Allow 1-4 weeks for the correspondence period

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Brief correspondents on the research focus and what to pay attention to (20 min per person)
2. Provide documentation tools and templates: camera, journal, reporting template (5 min)
3. Correspondents observe and document their context independently over the defined period (1-4 weeks)
4. Schedule weekly check-ins to hear preliminary observations and redirect focus if needed (15 min per check-in)
5. Collect all documentation: photos, journals, reports, artifacts (post-period)
6. Have each correspondent present their findings to the team (15-20 min each)
7. Cross-reference observations: where do correspondents agree? Where do they diverge? (15 min)
8. Synthesize insights relevant to the design challenge (15 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Not providing enough structure: correspondents need clear focus areas or they report on everything and nothing
- Not checking in regularly: weekly touchpoints keep the research on track
- Ignoring the correspondent's unique perspective: their biases and surprises are data, not noise

**Remote Adaptation**
- This method is inherently remote-friendly -- correspondents operate independently
- Use a shared Slack channel or WhatsApp group for ongoing observation sharing
- Create a shared Notion or Google Doc for structured reporting

**Output**: Collection of contextual reports from diverse locations/perspectives with cross-referenced themes and design implications

---

### Narration

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Identify the activity to be narrated: a task, workflow, or experience the participant performs
- Set up recording equipment: audio recorder or video camera
- Prepare the environment so the participant can perform the activity naturally
- Brief the participant: "Do the task as you normally would, but talk out loud about what you are doing and thinking"
- Have follow-up questions ready for when the narration is complete

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Ask the participant to begin the activity and narrate their thoughts, decisions, and actions as they go (2 min intro)
2. Let them proceed without interruption unless they go silent for more than 30 seconds (ongoing, 15-45 min depending on task)
3. If they go silent, prompt gently: "What are you thinking right now?" or "What is happening?" (as needed)
4. Note moments of hesitation, backtracking, or expressed frustration (ongoing)
5. After the task is complete, replay any recorded segments and ask for elaboration on key moments (15 min)
6. Ask about anything they did not mention: "I noticed you did X -- can you tell me about that?" (10 min)
7. Transcribe or summarize the narration highlighting decision points and mental models (30-60 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Interrupting too frequently: let the natural flow of thought continue unless they stop
- Changing the task by talking about it: reassure participants that there are no right answers
- Only capturing actions, not thoughts: the value is in the reasoning, not the behavior

**Remote Adaptation**
- Conduct via screen share for computer-based tasks -- participant narrates while sharing their screen
- For physical tasks, use a phone on a stand pointed at the workspace while on a video call
- Record the session for detailed review later

**Output**: Annotated narration transcript highlighting decision points, mental models, pain points, and moments of uncertainty

---

### Surveys & Questionnaires

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define the research questions and what quantitative/qualitative data you need
- Draft the survey: keep it under 15 minutes completion time
- Use a mix of closed (rating scales, multiple choice) and open-ended questions
- Pilot the survey with 3-5 people and revise based on confusion or drop-offs
- Choose a distribution platform: Typeform, Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, Qualtrics
- Define the target sample size (aim for statistical significance if quantitative: 100+ respondents)

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Finalize survey questions after piloting -- fix ambiguous wording (30 min)
2. Set up the survey in the chosen platform with logic branching if needed (30 min)
3. Distribute to the target audience through appropriate channels (email, social media, in-product, etc.)
4. Monitor response rates and send reminders at 3 and 7 days (5 min per check)
5. Close the survey when you reach the target sample or the deadline (1 min)
6. Clean the data: remove incomplete responses, check for spam or pattern responses (30 min)
7. Analyze quantitative data: frequencies, cross-tabulations, correlations (60 min)
8. Code open-ended responses into themes using affinity clustering (60 min)
9. Present findings with visualizations and key statistical callouts (30 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Leading questions: "How much did you enjoy..." assumes enjoyment -- use neutral wording
- Double-barreled questions: "Was the product fast and easy?" -- split into two questions
- Survey fatigue: every unnecessary question reduces completion rate -- be ruthless about cutting
- Ignoring open-ended responses: they often contain the richest insights

**Remote Adaptation**
- Surveys are inherently remote-friendly
- Use embedded distribution: email invitations with direct survey links
- For international audiences, consider translation and cultural adaptation of questions

**Output**: Survey results report with quantitative summaries, visualizations, coded qualitative themes, and actionable findings

### Un-focus Group

**Preparation** (before the session)
- **Recruitment**: Recruit 6-10 diverse participants — mix customers, non-customers, and adjacent users. Use screener surveys to ensure diversity of perspective.
- Recruit 6-10 participants with deliberately diverse perspectives on the topic (mix of users, non-users, experts, novices)
- Design provocative prompts and activities, not just discussion questions
- Prepare stimulus materials: prototypes, scenarios, controversial statements, props
- Book a comfortable, informal space (not a sterile conference room)
- Arrange food and drinks to create a relaxed atmosphere
- Have two facilitators: one to lead, one to observe and take notes

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Welcome participants and set expectations: "This is not a focus group -- there are no wrong answers, and disagreement is welcome" (5 min)
2. Start with a fun, provocative icebreaker related to the topic (10 min)
3. Introduce a stimulus (prototype, scenario, provocative statement) and let conversation emerge naturally (15 min)
4. Use "yes, and" facilitation: build on what participants say rather than redirecting (ongoing)
5. When energy dips, introduce a new activity: role-play, drawing, building, debating (every 15-20 min)
6. Encourage productive disagreement: "Interesting -- does everyone agree? Who sees it differently?" (ongoing)
7. In the final 10 minutes, ask: "What is the one thing we should remember from this conversation?" (10 min)
8. Debrief with the observation team immediately after (15 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Running it like a traditional focus group: avoid round-robin questioning and moderator-dominated conversation
- Letting one personality dominate: use activities that require everyone to contribute (writing, drawing, voting)
- Recruiting too homogeneously: the "un" in un-focus group means deliberately diverse

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use breakout rooms for small group activities, then reconvene
- Send physical stimulus kits to participants in advance (prototypes, props, materials)
- Use anonymous digital tools (Mentimeter, Slido) for input that dominant personalities might otherwise suppress

**Output**: Rich qualitative data from diverse perspectives with captured debates, provocative ideas, and emergent themes

### Word-Concept Association

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Create a list of 15-30 words or concepts relevant to the design challenge
- Prepare response sheets or a digital form for capturing associations
- Recruit 8-15 participants from the target audience
- Decide between written associations (more private, less influenced) or verbal (richer but more influenced by prior responses)
- Prepare a timer or pacing mechanism

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Explain the exercise: "I will show you a word. Write the first 3 things that come to mind. Work quickly -- do not overthink." (3 min)
2. Present each word one at a time, giving 15-20 seconds per word for written responses (10-15 min total)
3. After the rapid association round, go back through the list and ask participants to explain their most interesting associations (15-20 min)
4. Probe surprising associations: "Why did [word] make you think of [association]?" (ongoing)
5. Compile all associations for each word into a frequency analysis (15 min)
6. Identify shared associations (widely held mental models) and divergent ones (unique perspectives) (10 min)
7. Map associations to design implications: what language resonates? What creates confusion or negative associations? (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Going too slowly: speed is essential -- rapid responses bypass rational filtering
- Using jargon or technical terms: use language your users actually use
- Analyzing only the most common associations: rare associations often reveal hidden needs

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use a Typeform or Google Form with timed sections for each word
- Conduct live via video call with screen-shared words and participants typing in a chat
- Use Mentimeter's word cloud feature for real-time aggregate visualization

**Output**: Association matrix showing what each concept evokes, with frequency analysis, semantic clusters, and implications for design language

## TRY Methods

Methods for building and testing prototypes and simulations to learn through making and experiencing.

---

### Behavior Sampling

> **Note:** IDEO categorizes Behavior Sampling as a TRY method because you are actively trying an experience sampling methodology — prompting participants to record activities at random intervals — as a research technique. While it feels observational, the "try" is in deploying and iterating on the sampling protocol itself.

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define the behaviors to sample: what activities, states, or interactions are you tracking
- Recruit 5-10 participants willing to be interrupted randomly over 3-7 days
- Set up a signaling mechanism: text messages, pager beeps, or phone alarms at random intervals
- Create a brief response form (under 2 minutes to complete): what are you doing, where, with whom, how are you feeling
- Program 5-8 random signals per day during waking hours

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Brief participants on the method: at each signal, immediately record what they are doing (10 min)
2. Do a practice round together to ensure they understand the response form (5 min)
3. Launch the sampling period -- send random signals via the chosen mechanism (3-7 days)
4. Monitor compliance: follow up with anyone who stops responding (as needed)
5. Collect all response data and compile into a database (30 min)
6. Analyze patterns: what are they doing at different times? How does mood relate to activity? (60 min)
7. Create activity pie charts and mood graphs across the sampling period (30 min)
8. Conduct brief follow-up interviews to explore interesting patterns (15 min per participant)

**Common Mistakes**
- Signal fatigue: more than 8 signals per day causes participants to stop responding
- Signals at predictable times: randomness is essential to capture the full range of behavior
- Response forms that are too long: every extra question reduces compliance -- keep it under 2 minutes

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use experience sampling apps: ExpiWell, PACO, or custom Typeform links sent via SMS
- Automate random signal delivery using scheduling tools
- This method is inherently remote-friendly since participants self-report

**Output**: Behavioral sampling dataset with time-activity analysis, mood patterns, and contextual factors across participants

---

### Be Your Customer

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Identify the specific customer experience to undergo (buying, onboarding, getting support, etc.)
- Ensure team members are NOT recognized as employees if testing your own company
- Create an observation template: what happened, how it felt, what worked, what did not
- Budget time for the full experience cycle (may be hours or days)
- Assign 2-4 team members to go through the experience independently

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Brief the team: go through the full customer experience as authentically as possible (10 min)
2. Each person independently goes through the customer journey from start to finish (variable, 1 hour to several days)
3. Document everything: keep receipts, screenshots, photos, notes on every interaction (ongoing)
4. Pay special attention to emotions: when did you feel confused, delighted, frustrated, ignored? (ongoing)
5. Note comparison points: how does this compare to competitors or other experiences? (ongoing)
6. Reconvene as a team and share experiences chronologically (30-45 min)
7. Map the collective journey on a whiteboard, marking pain points and bright spots (20 min)
8. Prioritize improvement areas based on shared experiences (15 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Not going through the FULL experience: shortcuts and insider knowledge invalidate the method
- Only noting functional issues: emotional and relational aspects of the experience matter more
- Doing it only once: customer experiences vary -- do it multiple times, at different times, through different channels

**Remote Adaptation**
- Go through digital customer experiences (website, app, chatbot) with screen recording
- Order products for delivery and document the unboxing and setup experience
- Call the support line and record your experience (check local recording consent laws)

**Output**: Customer experience report with journey map, emotional highs and lows, pain points, and prioritized improvement recommendations

---

### Bodystorming

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Identify the scenario or environment to simulate
- Find or create a physical space that approximates the real context (or go to the actual location)
- Gather props: cardboard boxes, foam, tape, paper -- anything to simulate objects and interfaces
- Recruit 4-8 participants willing to physically act out scenarios
- Brief the team: this is about using your body to think, not performing -- awkwardness is expected

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Set up the environment with props and spatial markers (10 min)
2. Describe the scenario: who are the users, what is the context, what are they trying to do (5 min)
3. Assign roles: some people are users, some are the "product" or "environment" (5 min)
4. Round 1: act out the current experience as it exists today -- note friction points (10-15 min)
5. Pause, discuss what felt awkward, difficult, or unnatural (10 min)
6. Round 2: improvise improvements -- anyone can call "freeze" and suggest a change to the scenario (15-20 min)
7. Round 3: act out the improved scenario to test how the changes feel physically (10-15 min)
8. Debrief: what did you learn that you would not have learned by just talking about it? (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Being too self-conscious to commit: the facilitator should go first and model uninhibited participation
- Staying in your head: the whole point is to think with your body -- encourage physical exploration
- Not capturing insights in real time: assign a dedicated note-taker who is not acting

**Remote Adaptation**
- Bodystorming is inherently physical and difficult to do remotely
- Partial adaptation: have each participant set up props in their own space and act out scenarios on video
- Alternative: use role-playing via video call (less spatial but retains the embodied element)

**Output**: Documented scenario explorations with physically-discovered friction points, improvised solutions, and embodied insights

---

### Empathy Tools

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Identify the user condition or experience you want to simulate (limited mobility, visual impairment, fatigue, stress, unfamiliarity, etc.)
- Gather or create simulation tools: blurring goggles, weighted gloves, earplugs, arm slings, non-dominant hand restriction, glasses smeared with Vaseline
- Design tasks that participants will attempt while impaired
- Recruit 4-8 team members who do not have the simulated condition
- Have the actual product or environment available for testing

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Explain the condition being simulated and why understanding it matters (5 min)
2. Demonstrate how to use the empathy tools (5 min)
3. Have participants put on the empathy tools and attempt to perform relevant tasks (15-20 min)
4. Let them struggle -- do not help unless there is a safety concern (ongoing)
5. After the experience, remove the tools and debrief: "What was most difficult? What surprised you?" (10 min)
6. Identify specific design failures that the empathy tools revealed (10 min)
7. Brainstorm modifications that would improve the experience for people with this condition (15 min)
8. Discuss limitations: this simulation gives a glimpse, not the full lived experience (5 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Treating simulation as equivalent to the real experience: always acknowledge the limitations
- Laughing at the awkwardness: set a respectful tone -- this is about empathy, not entertainment
- Only simulating physical disabilities: also simulate cognitive load, stress, time pressure, and unfamiliarity

**Remote Adaptation**
- Send empathy tool kits to participants (blurring glasses, gloves, earplugs)
- Have participants attempt digital tasks with one hand, with monitor brightness at minimum, or with a screen magnifier
- Simulate cognitive overload by adding a simultaneous mental task (count backwards from 100 by 7s)

**Output**: Accessibility and usability findings from empathy simulation, with specific design failures identified and improvement recommendations

---

### Experience Prototype

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define the experience to prototype: not just the product, but the full context of use
- Identify the key moments or interactions to simulate
- Gather materials to build a rough simulation: props, spaces, people playing roles, real or mock technology
- Recruit 3-6 participants or use team members as stand-in users
- Design the scenario script: what happens, in what order, and who does what

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Set up the experience environment: arrange the space, position props, brief role-players (15 min)
2. Walk through the scenario once as a dry run to catch setup issues (10 min)
3. Invite the first participant and set the scene: "Imagine you are..." (3 min)
4. Run the experience from beginning to end without breaking character (15-30 min)
5. Observe the participant's reactions, confusion, delight, and workarounds (ongoing)
6. After the experience, conduct an immediate debrief: "What worked? What felt wrong? What was missing?" (10 min)
7. Iterate: make quick changes based on feedback and run the next participant through (10 min between, 15-30 min per run)
8. After all sessions, compile observations and identify patterns across participants (30 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Over-polishing the prototype: roughness is fine -- the experience matters more than the aesthetics
- Not testing the full experience: include the before and after, not just the core interaction
- Not iterating between participants: the best learning comes from rapid changes between runs

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use video call staging: share screens, play roles via video, send physical props by mail
- Create a guided digital walkthrough using slides or a prototype tool (Figma, InVision)
- Use Wizard-of-Oz methods: simulate smart behavior manually behind the scenes

**Output**: Experience findings with participant reactions, iteration log, and refined experience design

---

### Informance

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Select the user experience or scenario to perform
- Write a loose script based on actual research findings and observations
- Assign roles to team members: user, product, environment, other people in the scenario
- Gather simple props and costumes to support the performance
- Invite the broader team or stakeholders as the audience
- Rehearse once loosely -- do not over-polish

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Introduce the concept: "We are going to perform a user's experience based on our research. This is informative performance -- informance." (3 min)
2. Perform the scenario, embodying the user's frustrations, workarounds, and emotions (5-10 min)
3. Pause at key moments and narrate the user's internal thoughts (integrated into performance)
4. After the performance, open discussion with the audience: "What did you notice? What surprised you?" (10 min)
5. Perform a second version showing how the experience could be improved (5-10 min)
6. Discuss the differences between the two versions (10 min)
7. Capture ideas and design implications that emerge from the discussion (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Making it too polished or entertaining: the goal is insight, not applause
- Not grounding it in real research: every scene should trace back to actual observation data
- Embarrassment preventing commitment: model enthusiasm and vulnerability as the facilitator

**Remote Adaptation**
- Perform via video call with basic props and costumes
- Pre-record the informance as a short video and screen-share it, then discuss live
- Use animation or storyboard slides as a supplement if live performance is too awkward remotely

**Output**: Shared team understanding of user experience, captured audience reactions, and design implications from the performance discussion

---

### Paper Prototyping

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define the interface, product, or system to prototype
- Gather materials: paper, card stock, sticky notes, markers, scissors, tape, transparency sheets
- Prepare a task scenario for testing the prototype
- Recruit 3-5 participants for testing (or test within the team first)
- Assign roles: "computer" (moves paper elements in response to user actions), facilitator, observer

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Sketch the main screens or components on paper -- include buttons, fields, and content areas (20-30 min)
2. Create movable elements for things that change: dropdown menus, dialog boxes, screen transitions (15 min)
3. Do a team walkthrough to catch missing screens or flows (10 min)
4. With a participant, explain: "This is a paper version of [product]. Tap where you would tap. I will update the screen." (3 min)
5. Give the task: "You want to [goal]. Show me how you would do that." (1 min)
6. As "computer," update the paper interface in response to the participant's actions -- do not help or explain (10-15 min per task)
7. Note where participants hesitate, tap wrong targets, or express confusion (ongoing)
8. After each session, discuss findings and revise the prototype before the next participant (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Making the prototype too detailed: sketch quality is sufficient -- detail slows you down and makes changes painful
- The "computer" person helping the user: respond only to their actions, do not explain or suggest
- Not iterating between participants: revise the prototype after each test

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use quick wireframes in Figma or Balsamiq instead of physical paper
- For actual paper: hold paper up to the camera and move elements while the participant points and speaks
- Use InVision or Marvel to link photographed paper screens into a clickable prototype

**Output**: Tested paper prototype with documented usability findings, iteration history, and refined interface design

---

### Predict Next Year's Headlines

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define the domain: what industry, topic, or product category are you forecasting
- Gather recent trend data and news headlines for context
- Prepare headline-writing templates: "_______ ANNOUNCES _______" or "THE END OF _______"
- Provide large paper or index cards and markers
- Recruit 6-12 participants with diverse perspectives on the domain

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Share current trends and recent headlines as context-setting (10 min)
2. Ask each person to individually write 3-5 headlines they predict for next year (10 min)
3. Share all headlines on a wall -- read them aloud (10 min)
4. Group similar headlines into theme clusters (10 min)
5. For each cluster, discuss: "What would have to be true for this headline to happen?" (15 min)
6. Vote on: most likely headlines, most desirable headlines, most feared headlines (10 min)
7. For the top-voted headlines, identify design implications: "If this happens, what should we build?" (15 min)
8. Identify early signals that would indicate each headline is coming true (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Being too conservative: encourage wild headlines alongside safe ones
- Not grounding headlines in evidence: ask "what makes you think this?" for each headline
- Ignoring undesirable headlines: things you hope will not happen still need to be planned for

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use a shared Miro board or Google Jamboard for headline cards
- Have participants submit headlines anonymously via a form, then reveal and discuss together
- Use dot voting digitally (Miro, Mentimeter) for prioritization

**Output**: Collection of predicted headlines organized by theme, with likelihood ratings, conditions for occurrence, and design implications

---

### Quick-and-Dirty Prototyping

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define what needs to be prototyped: a feature, interaction, form factor, or experience
- Gather rapid prototyping materials: foam core, cardboard, tape, hot glue, wire, clay, found objects, 3D printing pen
- Time-box the build phase strictly: 15-60 minutes maximum
- Prepare the evaluation criteria: what question should the prototype answer?
- Recruit 4-8 team members to build in parallel or in small teams

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Frame the challenge: "Build a prototype that answers [specific question] in [time limit]" (5 min)
2. Set the timer and let teams build -- encourage speed over craft (15-60 min)
3. No screens, no software -- hands and physical materials only (enforce this)
4. At the halfway mark, do a brief walk-around so teams can see each other's approaches (5 min)
5. When time is up, each team presents their prototype and explains their thinking (3-5 min each)
6. Test each prototype with a user scenario: can you demonstrate how this would be used? (5 min each)
7. Critique constructively: what works? What would you steal from another team's prototype? (10 min)
8. Identify the strongest ideas to carry forward into higher-fidelity prototyping (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Spending too long planning: start building within 2 minutes -- the materials will guide you
- Trying to make it look good: ugly prototypes that work are better than pretty ones that do not
- Only building one option: parallel prototypes with different approaches generate better solutions

**Remote Adaptation**
- Have participants build with household materials and show on camera
- Use timed design sprints in Figma for digital products
- Mail prototype kits to participants in advance with standardized materials

**Output**: Multiple rough prototypes exploring different approaches, with documented strengths, weaknesses, and ideas to carry forward

---

### Role-Playing

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define the scenario and roles: user, service provider, product, bystander, etc.
- Write brief role descriptions based on real research (not stereotypes)
- Prepare the environment or context for the role-play
- Recruit 4-8 participants willing to improvise
- Have a "freeze" or "rewind" mechanism planned for key moments

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Describe the scenario and assign roles -- give participants 2 minutes to get into character (5 min)
2. Start the role-play and let it unfold naturally (5-10 min)
3. Call "freeze" at interesting moments and ask characters: "What are you feeling right now? What do you need?" (3 min per freeze)
4. Call "rewind" to replay a moment differently: "What if the product did X instead?" (5 min per rewind)
5. After the first round, swap roles so participants experience multiple perspectives (5-10 min)
6. After all rounds, break character and debrief: "What did you learn in each role?" (10 min)
7. Identify moments of friction, unmet needs, and surprise in the role-plays (10 min)
8. Extract design requirements from the emotional and practical discoveries (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Not committing to the role: set the expectation that this requires genuine effort, not ironic detachment
- Only playing user roles: playing the product or service can reveal design constraints you would not otherwise see
- Not debriefing properly: the learning happens in the discussion, not just the acting

**Remote Adaptation**
- Conduct role-plays via video call -- participants can use simple props and backgrounds
- Use chat-based role-playing for people uncomfortable with performance
- Record role-plays for later analysis and team sharing

**Output**: Scenario insights from multiple perspectives, with identified friction points, emotional needs, and design requirements

---

### Scale Modelling

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define what is being modeled: a space, product, system, or environment
- Determine the appropriate scale (1:10, 1:50, etc.) based on what you are exploring
- Gather modeling materials: foam core, balsa wood, cardboard, clay, 3D-printed elements, figurines for scale
- Prepare the base (floor plan, terrain, or platform) at the correct scale
- Recruit 3-6 participants for collaborative model building

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Present the design challenge and explain what the model should explore (5 min)
2. Build the basic structure of the model collaboratively (20-30 min)
3. Place human figurines in the model to test spatial relationships and sight lines (10 min)
4. Walk through user scenarios using the model: move figurines through the space, simulate interactions (15 min)
5. Identify issues that only become apparent in 3D: crowding, dead ends, visibility problems, scale mismatches (10 min)
6. Iterate: modify the model in real time to test alternatives (15 min)
7. Photograph the model from multiple angles, including "user eye level" shots (10 min)
8. Document design decisions and spatial principles that emerged from the model (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Making the model too precious: it should be changed, broken, and rebuilt as you learn
- Forgetting to include people: always have human-scale figurines to test proportions
- Building at the wrong scale: too small and you lose detail, too large and you lose context

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use SketchUp, Blender, or Tinkercad for collaborative 3D modeling
- Have each participant build a physical model at home and share via camera
- Use Minecraft or similar spatial tools for quick environmental prototyping

**Output**: Physical or digital scale model with documented spatial insights, identified issues, and design principles

---

### Scenarios

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Define the user types and contexts from earlier research
- Identify 3-5 key scenarios to explore: typical use, edge case, first-time use, failure recovery, etc.
- Create a scenario template: user, context, goal, steps, emotional state, outcome
- Gather relevant character profiles or personas to anchor the scenarios
- Recruit 4-8 team members for collaborative scenario writing

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Select a character profile and a scenario type to develop first (5 min)
2. Set the scene: where is the user, what time of day, what just happened, what are they trying to do? (5 min)
3. Walk through the scenario step by step: what does the user do, think, and feel at each point? (15 min)
4. At each step, ask: "What could go wrong here? What would make this delightful?" (ongoing)
5. Write the complete scenario as a narrative with embedded design requirements (15 min)
6. Repeat for additional scenarios, varying the user type, context, and conditions (15 min each)
7. Review all scenarios for coverage: have you addressed typical, extreme, and failure cases? (10 min)
8. Prioritize scenarios by frequency and impact for design focus (10 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Only writing happy-path scenarios: failure, frustration, and edge cases are where the real design work is
- Making scenarios too abstract: include specific, concrete details about the person and their context
- Not grounding scenarios in research: scenarios should be plausible extensions of observed behavior, not fiction

**Remote Adaptation**
- Use a shared Google Doc with a scenario template for collaborative writing
- Assign scenario drafts to individuals, then workshop together via video call
- Use storyboarding tools (Storyboard That, Boords) for visual scenario development

**Output**: Set of detailed user scenarios covering typical, extreme, and failure cases, with embedded design requirements

---

### Scenario Testing

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Gather the scenarios and prototypes developed in earlier phases
- Recruit 3-6 participants who match the scenario's target user type
- Set up the testing environment to match the scenario context as closely as possible
- Prepare the prototype (paper, digital, physical, or experience-based)
- Create an observation guide with key moments to watch for in each scenario
- Set up recording equipment (screen capture, video, audio)

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Brief the participant on the scenario context without revealing what the prototype does (3 min)
2. Present the prototype and give the scenario-based task: "You are [character] and you want to [goal]..." (2 min)
3. Observe the participant working through the scenario -- do not help or explain (10-15 min)
4. Note where the scenario assumptions break down: did the user behave as predicted? (ongoing)
5. After the task, debrief: "How realistic was this scenario? What would really happen?" (10 min)
6. Ask: "What is missing from this situation? What did we get wrong?" (5 min)
7. Repeat with additional participants and scenarios (10-15 min each)
8. Compare observations across participants: where do scenarios hold up? Where do they fail? (15 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Testing the prototype without testing the scenario: the scenario itself may be wrong
- Coaching participants through the scenario: let them struggle and discover breakdowns naturally
- Not revising scenarios based on testing: scenario testing should update both the prototype AND the scenario

**Remote Adaptation**
- Conduct scenario tests via video call with screen sharing or physical prototype on camera
- Use Maze or Useberry for unmoderated digital scenario testing at scale
- Send scenario descriptions by email and have participants record themselves working through them

**Output**: Scenario validation report showing which scenarios and prototype elements work, which need revision, and discovered gaps

---

### Try It Yourself

**Preparation** (before the session)
- Identify the experience, task, or condition you want team members to try firsthand
- Ensure safety: risk-assess the experience and set boundaries
- Prepare the materials, environment, or access needed for the experience
- Brief the team on what to pay attention to: emotions, friction, surprises, workarounds
- Schedule enough time for the full experience, not a shortened version

**Facilitation Steps**
1. Explain what the team will be trying and why firsthand experience matters (5 min)
2. Each team member goes through the full experience individually (variable, 30 min to several hours)
3. During the experience, take notes on: what is hard, what is confusing, what is delightful, what is missing (ongoing)
4. Pay attention to your emotional state throughout -- frustration, boredom, anxiety, satisfaction (ongoing)
5. Immediately after, write down your top 3 observations while the experience is fresh (5 min)
6. Reconvene as a team and share experiences, going person by person (20-30 min)
7. Map shared experiences and unique observations on a whiteboard (15 min)
8. Translate personal experiences into design insights and requirements (15 min)

**Common Mistakes**
- Not doing the full experience: shortcuts rob you of critical insights -- commit fully
- Assuming your experience is universal: your expertise, context, and abilities differ from real users
- Not documenting in real time: memory fades fast -- write notes during or immediately after

**Remote Adaptation**
- Assign self-try experiences as homework with a structured reflection template
- Have participants record their experience on video or audio for shared review
- Reconvene via video call to share and synthesize experiences

**Output**: Team experience log with individual observations, shared patterns, emotional journey, and translated design insights
